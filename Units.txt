Sizes are measured in cm, densities in g/cm^3, Strengths are mor or less made up, at least for the moment

Melee Damage Calculations:

Raw Damage = Force * Mass

Blunt Damage = Raw Damage / Contact Area, usual range is 0 - 1000

Cutting Damage = Raw Damage * Sharpness, usual range is 0 - 15000

Piercing Damage = (Raw Damage * Sharpness) / Contact Area, usual range is 0 - 100000

Peirce Rating = min(Penetration, Raw Damage) / Contact Area

Melee Result Calculations

Item Resistances  = Material Resistances * Thickness
